# Cuppa-Stocks
Your morning ritual, with a shot of market insights
## Description
The Cuppa Stocks app is designed to provide the most current news on index funds, commodities, and provide news snippets to financial articles all in the amount of time it takes to enjoy your morning cuppa coffee! The goal was to provide a single place to simultaneously view relevant market information and quickly be able to navigate to your favorite trading app so that you can apply the app’s information to real-world trading decisions.

## User Story
As a user I am interested in having an engaging financial app that I can open in the morning while I’m having my cup of coffee. I want the app to be able to show me current market information and have news snippets that will link to the full article if I want to read more. I want the app to be responsive so that I can use it on all of my favorite devices and intuitive to navigate so that everything I want to see is right there.

## Usage
The user is advised to try out our table by clicking tabs to see different commodity data being displayed. The user can also view snippets of financial news articles, read the complete article by clicking on the "read more" link, or clicking the heart icon next to the snippet which will allow the user to "favorite" the selected article and save it in the favorites section for enjoyment at a future date.
